# 3-player-chess

We will create a digital version of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-man_chess) chess game.

For starters we want to make a interactive game, available at the local computer but we have several ideas of features if we have the time. For instance we might want to create some sort of web version of the game and possibly create some sort of AI that can play the game.

We are planning on using C# and Unity to create the project.
